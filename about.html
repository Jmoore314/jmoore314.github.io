<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Poirot is an English (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"> England</a>) crime-drama series feathuring a fictional Belgian detective, created by Agatha Christie. Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, appearing in 33 novels, one play (Black Coffee), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975.</p>
	<p>Christie has been purposefully vague about Poirot's origins, as he is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In An Autobiography, she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.</p>
